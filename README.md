This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree program

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data, compared the temperature trends of Paris to overall global temperature trends.

Finally, using Excel, I created visualizations and prepared a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends for Paris, Berlin.

Tools: SQL, EXcel

Steps: I extracted the data using SQL from a database and exported as a .csv file
Analysed and created charts using Excel
Created a report to share observations and findings
